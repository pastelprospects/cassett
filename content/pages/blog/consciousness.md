> *"In simple terms, consciousness is everything perceived"*

What exactly is consciousness and how do we nurture it? Well, we can begin answering our two-part question by addressing what's most immediately obvious. Let's start by defining consciousness:

> *(noun)*
>
> 1.  (a) the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself; (b) the state or fact of being conscious of an external object, state, or fact; (c) awareness and/or concern for some social or political cause
>
> 2.  the state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought
>
> 3.  the totality of conscious states of an individual
>
> 4.  the normal state of conscious life regained consciousness
>
> 5.  the upper level of mental life of which the person is aware as contrasted with unconscious processes
>
>     *Merriam-Webster Dictionary*

Consciousness is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been pondered by philosophers, scientists, and theologians. It generally refers to the subjective experience of being aware of oneself and the world around us. Some key aspects that are often associated with consciousness include:

1.  Subjectivity: Consciousness is inherently subjective, meaning it is experienced from a personal perspective.

2.  Qualia: The qualitative aspects of conscious experience, such as the redness of swelling or the painfulness of a headache, are often referred to as qualia.

3.  Self-awareness: Consciousness involves being aware of oneself as a separate entity from the world around us.

4.  Wakefulness: Consciousness is typically associated with being awake and alert, as opposed to being asleep or unconscious.

In simple terms, consciousness is everything perceived. The complicated part is that perspective doesn't remain constant. Imagine walking through a museum. As you move closer towards and further away from each exhibit your perception is altered. Although our perspective shifts, what we perceive remains chronologically in tact, absent an anomaly. The way our mind collects everything we perceive to provide a holistic 'picture' is our consciousness.

Ultimately, consciousness is the active processing of the perceived world to inform and construct a fulsome perspective. Our perspective is ever-evolving but it takes shape as a result of cognitive processes, personal experiences, cultural exposure, education, social interaction, consumption of media, learned biases, etc. To nurture consciousness is to actively seek a complete picture of the percieved world we inhabit.
