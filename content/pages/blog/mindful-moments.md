A mindful moment is a brief pause where you intentionally focus your attention on the present, observing your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. Typical practices include deep breathing, meditation, or simply observing your surroundings. The objective is to increase awareness and cultivate a sense of calm and clarity in the present moment in order to reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Mindful moments can be seamlessly woven into your daily routine.

Although mindful moments require intentionality they can be easily incorporated into our habitual regimen. For example, practicing mindful moments can include:

1.  Mindful Breathing: Take a few minutes to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, then exhale slowly through your mouth. Pay attention to the rhythm of your breathing and the sensations in your body.

2.  Nature Walk: While walking outside, fully engage your senses. Notice the colors of the leaves, the sounds of birds, the feeling of the ground under your feet, and the smell of fresh air. If your mind wanders, gently bring your focus back to your surroundings.

3.  Mindful Eating: When you have a meal, take time to savor each bite. Notice the flavors, textures, and aromas of the food. Chew slowly and appreciate the nourishment it provides.

4.  Body Scan: Set aside a few minutes to do a body scan. Sit or lie down comfortably, then mentally check in with each part of your body from your toes to your head, noticing any tension or feelings without trying to change them.

5.  Gratitude Reflection: Take a moment to reflect on three things you are grateful for. Allow yourself to fully feel the gratitude and consider why these things matter to you.

6.  Mindful Listening: When having a conversation, practice active listening. Focus completely on the person speaking, noticing their tone, body language, and emotions without planning your response while they talk.

7.  Everyday Tasks: Engage in routine activities, like washing dishes or brushing your teeth, with full attention. Notice the sensations, movements, and sounds involved in the task.

> "Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression. Practicing \[mindful moments] can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage with the world around you."

Engaging in mindful moments requires that we are fully present without judgement. The ability to be wholly present is a skill that requires constant training. We often either overemphasize the past or attempt to project a future we believe and perceieve. When doing so, we allow our perceived judgement to influence the present moment. A truly mindful moment is an unfiltered experience with our immediate reality to better inform our awareness and consciousness.
