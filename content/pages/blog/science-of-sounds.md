Let's admit it: music moves us. Whether it's a catchy melody or lullaby, we can't avoid how sounds capture our attention. Sometimes sound is just noise. Oftentimes sound is literally music to our ears. If sounds impact the environment around us then why wouldn't they impact the environment within us?

The science of sounds in layman's terms is acoustics, which is understood to be study of the physical properties of sound, its production, transmission, and perception. Our focus is primarily on perception. Our perception of sound, whether it be volume, tone, cadence etc., influences both our internal and external environments. The external is a bit more obvious because we often associate sounds with spaces. The internal is more difficult to tease out due to its interplay with the external.

> *Our perception of sound, whether it be volume, tone, cadence etc., influences both our internal and external environments.*

Scientifically speaking, sound waves are a displacement of air molecules that result from vibrations. Sounds influence our environment by dictating vibes. The tricky part is that our mood tends to be contingent upon or, at the very least, highly dependent on vibes. Sounds, specifically songs, can impact our mood in the following ways:

1.  Emotional Resonance: Music can trigger specific emotional responses based on its melody, rhythm, and lyrics. For instance, upbeat, major-key music often induces feelings of happiness and optimism, while slower, minor-key music can evoke sadness or introspection.

2.  Memory Association: Music is closely tied to our memories. Hearing a particular song can evoke powerful emotional memories, bringing back feelings of joy, nostalgia, or even sadness.

3.  Physiological Changes: Listening to music can trigger physiological changes in our bodies, such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and hormone levels. These changes can influence our emotional state.

4.  Social Connection: Music can bring people together and create a sense of community. Sharing music with others can foster social bonds and improve our mood.

In conclusion, sounds and songs influence vibes which significantly impact our mood. By understanding how sounds affect our emotions, we can use them to enhance our well-being and improve our awareness.
